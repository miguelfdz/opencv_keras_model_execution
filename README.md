# OpenCV image recognition model execution

This is a Python code to execute image recognition models in keras format, a pre-trained model was created with **TeachableMachine** tool then exported in order to be used in this Python code.

This model was trained to detect the following products:
- Fritos® sal y limón
- Fritos® chile y limón
- Paketaxo® quexo
- Cheetos® poffs®
- Cheetos® xtra flamin hot®
- Tostitos® salsa verde
- Tostitos® flamin hot®
- Ruffles® queso
- Sabritas® original
- Sabritas® adobadas
> **Note:** This labels can be found in the **labels.txt** file as well, with their corresponding index in the output given by this model.
